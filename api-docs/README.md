Swagger Documentation for Address API
=====================================

The Address API is documented in the "swagger.json" file in this directory. The documentation conforms to the [Swagger specification for describing REST APIs](http://swagger.io). The remaining files and subdirectories are just a snapshot of the [Swagger UI distribution](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui), which is an open-source product for displaying an API catalog that has been documented in Swagger-compliant form.

To add or modify the documentation, simply alter the "swagger.json" file. The "paths" node contains the endpoints, and the "definitions" node contains the descriptions of the response objects. For a complete reference, check out [the specification](http://swagger.io/specification/).

Eventually, we should look at further isolating what is unique to our project (the JSON documentation) from the Swagger UI distribution.
